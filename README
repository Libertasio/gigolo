Gigolo
^^^^^^


About
=====
Gigolo is a frontend to easily manage connections to remote filesystems using
GIO/GVfs. It allows you to quickly connect/mount a remote filesystem and manage
bookmarks of such.

GVfs is an userspace virtual filesystem and the successor of GnomeVfs but doesn't
depend on Gnome itself. It only requires a recent GLib version and a properly setup
DBus system. Then it provides almost transparent access to remote
resources like FTP or SFTP (SSH) connections, SMB (windows shares) or special resources
like the Trash (trash://), Burn (burn://) or even accessing your digital photo camera
(gphoto2://).


Requirements
============
For compiling Gigolo, you will need the GTK (>= 2.12.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Cairo, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.
You also need Python for the included Waf build system.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler as well as the intltool package.


Installation
============
If you have all the above listed requirements installed on your system,
building the code is easy:

Run the following commands::

    $ ./waf configure
    $ ./waf build
    (maybe as root)
    % ./waf install

To get a list of available options to customize your build, enable debugging
or to use a different installation prefix, run::

    $ ./waf help


Alternative installation using autotools

You can use the usual autotools chain to configure, compile and install
the sources by running::

    $ ./autogen.sh

in the source directory.
This is mainly intended for distro packagers and people with special needs.


Usage

You can start Gigolo in the following ways:

* From the Desktop Environment menu:

  Choose in your application menu of your used Desktop Environment:
  System --> Gigolo.
