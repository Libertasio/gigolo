Gigolo
^^^^^^


About
=====
Gigolo is a frontend to easily manage connections to local and remote filesystems
using GIO/GVfs. It allows you to quickly connect/mount a remote filesystem and manage
bookmarks of such.

GVfs is an userspace virtual filesystem and the successor of GnomeVfs but doesn't
depend on Gnome itself. It only requires a recent GLib version and a properly setup
DBus system. Then it provides almost transparent access to remote
resources like FTP or SFTP (SSH) connections, SMB (windows shares) or special resources
like the Trash (trash://), Burn (burn://) or even accessing your digital photo camera
(gphoto2://).


Requirements
============
For compiling Gigolo, you will need the GTK (>= 2.12.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Cairo, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler as well as the intltool package.


Installation
============
If you have all the above listed requirements installed on your system,
building the code is easy:

Run the following commands::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    (maybe as root)
    % make install

If there is no configure script, you probably need to run::

    $ ./autogen.sh

in the source directory before


Usage
=====
You can start Gigolo in the following ways:

* From the Desktop Environment menu:

  Choose in your application menu of your used Desktop Environment:
  System --> Gigolo.

* From the command line:

  To start Gigolo from a command line, type the following and press Return::

      $ gigolo

* To get a list of available command line options, run::

      $ gigolo --help
