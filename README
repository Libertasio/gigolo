About

Sion is a frontend to easily manage connections to remote filesystems using
GIO/GVFS. It allows you to quickly connect/mount a remote filesystem and manage
bookmarks of such.


Requirements

For compiling Sion, you will need the GTK (>= 2.12.0) libraries
and header files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header
files, such as Pango, Cairo, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at
http://www.gtk.org.
You also need Python for the included Waf build system.

Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler as well as the intltool package.


Installation

If you have all the above listed requirements on your system installed,
building the code is easy:

Run the following commands::
